# Super_SloMo_Implementation

## Introduction

This is an implementation of the paper: Super SloMo: High Quality Estimation of Multiple Intermediate Frames for Video Interpolation by Huaizu Jiang, Deqing Sun, Varun Jampani, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Erik Learned-Miller, Jan Kautz [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00080)

This would mostly be done in Google Colab and I will try my best to recreate this using PyTorch if possible. Will post updates and results when available.
